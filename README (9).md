# Breast Cancer Predictor

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis app is a machine learning-based tool designed to support medical professionals in identifying breast cancer. By analyzing a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It also provides a visual overview of the input data through a radar chart and displays both the predicted diagnosis and the probability of the mass being benign or malignant. Users can either enter the measurements manually or connect the app to a cytology lab to receive data directly from lab equipment. Note that the app itself does not handle the lab connection.
